She is vegetarian.Amy decided to be a cow because she relates a lot to this animal. She says it's one of her autistic trait to relate to animals. She has en empathic connection to cows. It might be because of that that she became vegetarian. She also thinks she's a little big like a cow and docile like them, and have a lot of emotional connections.<br>I met first her Tulpa, <a data-href="Chelsea" href="droplet/chelsea.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chelsea</a>, but I don't know how long after, I met her too. <a data-href="Chelsea" href="droplet/chelsea.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chelsea</a> was at first a character in a story she wrote.

I wish she could tell me more about her druidic adventures. I know she did something with a tree branch? But I forgot. [It was Birch]. Maybe I'll do an entry for her druidic adventures.I tell her almost everything that happens in my life, and let her watch my journal. But if one day I have too sensitive information to put in the journal, like somewhere that could lead someone to find the real people behind those entries, I won't put them online. I think for now pictures are okay, facial recognition isn't accessible to most people.2025-01-29 / 16:20She is currently waiting for two albums to come out in February, she likes the Metal genre.
